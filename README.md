## Image Preprocessing Techniques Used

### 1.) Image Segmentation
Five methods were used for image segmentation techniques which were Threshold-based segmentation, Cluster-based segmentation, Region-based segmentation, Watershed segmentation, Edge-based segmentation.

Evaluation metrices used was Intersection over Union with "watershed segmentation" showing better results than other techniques which was 0.6789.

### 2.) Image Enhancement
Four methods were used for image enhancement which were Histogram Equalization & Histogram Matching, Contrast Convolution & Correlation, Smoothening Spatial Filter & Sharpening Spatial Filter and High pass Frequency Domain & Low pass Frequency Domain.

Evaluation metrices used was Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) with "histogram equalization" showing better results than other which was 0.939839.

Histogram Equalization shows good results for contrast of image. Similarly, convolution operation for Sharpening of image and laplacian filter(sharpening) & gaussian filter(smoothening) for spatial domain.

### 3.) Image Restoration
Eight methods were used for image restoration which were Gaussian noise, Impulse noise, Poisson noise, Exponential noise, Gamma noise, Rayleigh noise, Uniform noise and Periodic noise.

Evaluation metrics used was Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) which was 33.766 dB after Gaussion, impulse, rayleigh and other noise being removed.

### 4.) Morphological Operations 
Two methods were used which were Dilation and Erosion
## Tranfer Learning Models Used

### 1.) CNN Architecture

### 2.) VGG_19

### 3.) MobileNet

## Class Balancing with SMOTE
